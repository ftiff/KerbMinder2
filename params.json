{"name":"Kerbminder2","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome\r\nKerbMinder is a tool that takes care of Kerberos behind the scenes.\r\nIf your computer is bound to AD, this is already taken care of. But Apple's implementation doesn't work well with ticket renewal. I'm not an expert of this, ask @pmbuko instead.\r\nBut when you computer is not bound to AD, you need to use Ticket Viewer.app. This tool is IMHO simple but misleading for the user. And it requires some intervention each time the ticket expires.\r\n\r\n### Meet KerbMinder2. \r\nThis tool will ask the user for principal and/or password, and take care of the init and renewal of the ticket each time it detects a network change. It will handle nicely AD errors.\r\n\r\n### Why the '2' in KerbMinder2 ?\r\nThis is a fork and a rewrite of @pmbuko [KerbMinder](http://github.com/pmbuko/KerbMinder). My intent is to make it backward compatible and do a Pull Request. \r\nOriginally, KerbMinder needed the computer to be bound. I personally think this is a thing from the past, so I added the possibility to specify a principal. After hours of struggling with the code to make, I figured out it would be much faster to do a complete rewrite. I don't intend to correct the bugs or enhance pmbuko's version. \r\n\r\n### What's next ?\r\nI want to rewrite this tool again, to use Apple's Frameworks instead of CLI tools.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
