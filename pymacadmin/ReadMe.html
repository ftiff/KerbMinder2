      A collection of Python utilities for Mac OS X system administration
    </p>
    <p>
      The PyMacAdmin project started as a collaboration between Chris Adams
      and Nigel Kersten to develop a replacement for the unsupported 'kicker'
      feature included in OS X prior to 10.5. That replacement eventually
      became crankd, which provides a way to execute Python code or a shell
      script in response to many system events: network changes, filesystem
      activity, application launching, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second major features was the disk image unit testing framework
      designed to test OS X installation images before deployment and we've
      since gained or had contributed utilities to create network locations,
      manage proxy settings or update AirPort passwords using our Keychain
      wrapper.
