A collection of Python utilities for Mac OS X system administration.

The PyMacAdmin project started as a collaboration between Chris Adams and
Nigel Kersten to develop a replacement for the unsupported 'kicker' feature
included in OS X prior to 10.5. That replacement eventually became crankd,
which provides a way to execute Python code or a shell script in response to
many system events: network changes, filesystem activity, application
launching, etc.

A second major features is the disk image unit testing framework designed to
test OS X installation images before deployment.

We've also added utilities to create network locations, manage proxy settings
or update AirPort passwords using our Keychain wrapper.
